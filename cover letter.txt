To whom it may concern:

My name is Daniel Li and I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying EECS and applied mathematics (Spring '17). I am interested in computational mathematics, data analysis, and software engineering (preferably a combination of the three).

A more detailed profile of myself is available at http://danielli97.github.io and my projects are available at http://github.com/danielli97.

I look forward to talking with you!

Best regards,
Daniel Li
